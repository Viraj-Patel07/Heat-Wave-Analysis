# Heatwave analysis

## Objectives:
* To analyse pattern and trend of temperature events over Gujarat state, India
* To identify extreme weather evente i.e. Heatwaves over the same area
* To analyse Duration, Intensity and Frequency of Heatwaves

## Team members:

## Data:
1. Study area : Gujarat, India
2. Land Surface Temperature (LST) : [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C01_T1_8DAY_TOA)
3. Gujarat state Shape(.shp) file

## Install required packages:
~~~
!pip install matplotlib
~~~

## Assumptions:
Land Surface Temperature (LST) behaves similarly like 2m Air Temperature
LST and 2m Air Temperature have difference of 6⁰ to 8⁰
